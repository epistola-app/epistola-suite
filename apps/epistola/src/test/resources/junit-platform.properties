# JUnit 5 parallel test execution is DISABLED for now.
# Tests share a single database instance via Testcontainers, and current test
# isolation (deleteAllTenants in @BeforeEach) causes race conditions when
# tests run in parallel.
#
# To enable parallel execution in the future, implement:
# 1. Unique tenant prefixes per test class
# 2. Per-class cleanup that only deletes own tenants
#
# Current test execution time (~30s) already meets the target (<60s), so
# parallel execution is not needed at this time.

junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled=false
